# 🎓 E-Learning App

A beautifully crafted weather app built with React Native. This project is entirely **UI-based**, using **static/mock data** to simulate a real-world weather application. It focuses on showcasing layout design, user interface structure, and component styling without relying on live APIs or real-time data.

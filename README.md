# 🎓 E-Learning App
A beautifully designed UI prototype for an e-learning platform built with React Native. This project is entirely **UI-based**, using **static/mock data** to showcase the visual design and user experience of an educational app without backend integration.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **React Native**
- **JavaScript**
- **Styled Components / Custom CSS**
